The Monty Hall Problem first appeared in the "Ask Marilyn" column in Parade Magazine in 1990:

"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, 'Do you want to pick door No. 2?' Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?"

The answer, perhaps suprisingly, is yes, your chance of winning is increased when you switch from your original choice. Below you can simulate either switching doors or always sticking with the original choice.
